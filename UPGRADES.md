# UPGRADES.md - the graft log (how Rootstock updates without overwriting)

CURRENT KIT VERSION: **v1.2** (this file is the single source of truth for
the kit's version; entries below are append-only, oldest first).

Search keys: updates, upgrade, graft, version, pull changes, kit update.

## Why updates are GRAFTS, never file copies

An installed Rootstock is an ADAPTATION, not a copy: the receiving Claude
renamed paths, tailored CLAUDE.md, rewired scripts, and the project has
since grown its own knowledge INTO those files. Copying a newer kit file
over an installed one would destroy exactly the thing the system exists to
protect. So the kit never updates files in a project - it updates CONCEPTS.
Each entry below is a scion: the idea, where it lives in the kit, and how
to graft it onto a project's own files, whatever they are named there.

## THE GRAFT PROTOCOL (for the Claude performing an update)

1. Find the installed version: the project's CLAUDE.md carries a line
   "Rootstock vX.Y installed ..." (an install that predates version marks
   counts as v1.0 - add the line while you are there).
2. Get the current kit (the CEO hands you the folder, or pull
   github.com/Mazhron/rootstock-os) and read THIS file's entries NEWER
   than the installed version.
3. For each entry, in order: read its GRAFT instructions, then apply the
   concept to the project's OWN files - additive edits in the project's
   own names, paths, and voice. NEVER copy a kit file over an existing
   project file. A file the project does not have at all (a genuinely new
   MD or reference script) may be copied fresh, then adapted and indexed.
4. If a graft contradicts something the CEO customized on purpose, THE
   CONTRADICTION RULE applies: flag it, ask, never silently overwrite
   their choice with ours.
5. Bump the project's "Rootstock vX.Y installed" line to the new version
   and ship the batch. One graft batch per update; the project's own
   changelog records what was grafted.

## The entries

### v1.0 - 2026-09-03 - The public release
WHAT: the four pillars as first published: the knowledge wiki
(WIKI_METHOD.md), the reporting discipline (REPORTING_METHOD.md), the
delegation company (SUBAGENT_METHOD.md), the skills shelf (SKILLS.md +
skills/), the front door install order, and the verbatim checkpoint law
(both sides of the final exchange, exact words).
CARRIES: every kit file at publication.
GRAFT: not applicable - this is the baseline an install starts from.

### v1.1 - 2026-09-03 - The usage sheet
WHAT: the harness transcripts (~/.claude/projects/) meter every request
for real - model, input/output/thinking tokens, cache reads/writes, every
tool call named, sub-agents included. A miner script aggregates them into
one regenerated CSV+TXT sheet: totals per day/week/month per model and
per tool, workstation-keyed. Ends self-estimated token figures; shows
where context money actually goes (first finding: file Reads dwarf
everything - the wiki diet is the lever).
CARRIES: REPORTING_METHOD.md section "The usage sheet: mine the harness
meter, never self-estimate"; reference tools/usage_report.py; front door
STEP 2 paragraph.
GRAFT: copy usage_report.py fresh into the project's tools/, adapt its
output paths + the project-name filter in transcript_dirs(), add it to
the project's runner/metrics group, and add the section to the project's
copy of REPORTING_METHOD.md (or its local equivalent). Nothing existing
is touched.

### v1.2 - 2026-09-03 - The graft log itself
WHAT: this update mechanism. The kit carries a version and an append-only
log of concept entries; installs carry a "Rootstock vX.Y installed" line
in CLAUDE.md; updates are performed by grafting newer entries onto the
project's own files per the protocol above.
CARRIES: UPGRADES.md (this file); front door STEP 1 (the version line) +
the UPDATING section.
GRAFT: add the "Rootstock v1.2 installed" line to the project's CLAUDE.md
index. Do NOT copy this file into projects - the graft log lives in the
KIT only, where it stays current; a project needs just its version line.
